## üöÄ The Vision: Beyond Surveillance, Towards Proactive Safety

Traditional surveillance often means sifting through hours of footage *after* an event. AEYE aims to change that by providing proactive insights. We believe in using advanced AI to:

*   **See with Context:** Understand scenes based on user-defined context, not just generic object detection.
*   **Alert with Clarity:** Deliver AI-generated narratives of incidents for immediate understanding.
*   **Empower Swift Action:** Provide timely information to enable faster, more informed responses.

**AEYE is about transforming video data into a tool for anticipation and mitigation.**

## ‚ú® Key Features & Capabilities

*   **Advanced AI Core:** Powered by **Google's Gemini Pro Vision API** for sophisticated multimodal understanding.
*   **Context-Aware Analysis:** Users define "Scene Context" to tailor AEYE's analysis for higher relevance.
*   **Incident Detection (Prototype Focus):**
    *   üö∂ **Trespassing / Unauthorized Access**
    *   üëú **Abandoned Objects**
    *   ‚ùì **Suspicious Loitering/Behavior**
    *   üë• **Unusual Crowd Activity/Disturbances**
*   **Descriptive Alerts:** AI-generated textual descriptions of incidents, providing rich context alongside visual evidence (screenshots).
*   **Serverless Architecture:**
    *   Video uploads handled via **Firebase Storage**.
    *   Video processing and Gemini API interaction managed by **Firebase Functions** (or a similar backend service triggered by Firebase events).
*   **Modern Web Interface:** Built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS** for a responsive and intuitive user experience to upload videos, define context, and view real-time alerts.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started (Prototype - Local Setup with Firebase Emulators)

This prototype utilizes Firebase services. For local development, using the **Firebase Emulator Suite** is highly recommended.

**Prerequisites:**

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended, includes npm/yarn)
*   Firebase CLI installed and configured: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
*   A Google Cloud Project with the Gemini API enabled and an **API Key**.
*   A Firebase Project created and configured for this application (Storage, Functions, Firestore/Realtime DB).
*   **[If your video processing in Firebase Functions relies on external tools like FFmpeg not bundled by default, specify any local setup needed for emulation, e.g., local FFmpeg installation.]**

**Setup & Run Instructions:**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aravindinduri/aeye.git
    ```

2.  **Configure Firebase:**
    *   Link your local project to your Firebase project: `firebase use YOUR_PROJECT_ID`
    *   Ensure your `firebase.json` is configured for Functions, Storage, and Firestore/Realtime DB.

3.  **Environment Variables (Frontend - Next.js):**
    *   Create a `.env.local` file in your Next.js project root (usually the main project root or a `frontend/` subfolder).
    *   Add your Firebase client-side configuration variables:
        ```env
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_FIREBASE_WEB_API_KEY
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_SENDER_ID
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID
        ```

4.  **Environment Variables (Backend - Firebase Functions):**
    *   Set your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` for Gemini securely for your Firebase Functions. This is typically done via:
        ```bash
        firebase functions:config:set gemini.key="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
        # You might have other config for service accounts if calling other Google Cloud services
        ```
    *   In your Function code, you'll access this via `functions.config().gemini.key`.

5.  **Install Dependencies:**
    *   For the Next.Alt texjs app (if it's the root or in a `frontend/` folder):
        ```bash
        npm install
        # or
        # yarn install
        ```
    *   For Firebase Functions (usually in a `functions/` folder):
        ```bash
        cd functions
        npm install
        # or
        # yarn install
        cd ..
        ```

6.  **Run with Firebase Emulators (Recommended):**
    *   Start the Firebase emulators:
        ```bash
        firebase emulators:start
        ```
    *   This will typically start emulators for Auth, Functions, Firestore, Storage, etc. Note the ports they are running on.
    *   Your Next.js app will connect to these emulated services.

7.  **Run the Next.js Development Server:**
    *   In a new terminal, start the Next.js app:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        # or
        # yarn dev
        ```
    *   The frontend app will typically run on `http://localhost:3000`.

8.  **Access the Application:**
    *   Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

9.  **Using AEYE:**
    *   Upload a video file (it will go to the emulated Firebase Storage).
    *   This should trigger your Firebase Function (running in the emulator).
    *   The Function processes the video, calls Gemini, and stores results in emulated Firestore/Realtime DB.
    *   The Next.js frontend should update with the analysis results.

## üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap (High-Level)

*   **Phase 1 (Current - Prototype):** Core functionality with Next.js, Firebase (Storage, Functions, Firestore), Gemini integration for offline video file analysis.
*   **Phase 2 (Enhancements):**
    *   Optimize video processing within Firebase Functions (or integrate robust cloud video service).
    *   Refine Gemini prompt engineering.
    *   Improve UI/UX for alert management and real-time updates.
*   **Phase 3 (Future Scope):**
    *   Investigate cost-effective strategies for video processing at scale.
    *   User authentication via Firebase Auth.
